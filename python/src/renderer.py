The renderer is responsible for building the primitives, and complex objects to be drawn by pyglet.  This module also contains various base classes for primitives which can be modified on the fly.

    This class allows access to the primitives (the basic drawing building blocks) to draw just about anything.  Widgets should use these to draw themselves::

                btn_base = renderer.Rectangle(x, y, width, height,

                # etc. 
                # etc.

    primitives should be called through the Renderer instance instead of through the class (i.e.)::
        
        renderer = Renderer()
        renderer.Rectangle()

    instead of::
        
        renderer = Renderer()
        Renderer.Rectangle(renderer=renderer)

    There is special python magic to make that work.  See `__init__()` for that.
