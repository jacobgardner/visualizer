Supplementary OpenGL Information
================================

This section is not required reading for doing 90% of the visualizer, but 
I have always felt it can be useful to know the background of a technology
when making decisions in your coding.

What is OpenGL?
---------------

OpenGL stands for OPEN Graphics Library.  But let's be clear here.  OpenGL
is neither open nor a graphics library in the general sense of either term. 
OpenGL is a tightly controlled standard set forth by the Khronos group, 
which has people on its board from many major OS and graphics chipset
providers. (e.g. Microsoft, Apple, NVidia, ATI, etc.)  

If you're not familiar with the concept of standards, then I'll explain here.
A standard is a name brand associated with a specification.  To say that you
are OpenGL compatible, or any other standard compatible, you must follow the
strict set of specifications in the standard or face potential legal
implications.  

So what OpenGL is, in a nutshell, is a set of rules that Graphics Card makers,
software renderer developers, and the like must follow in their drivers to say
that they run a certain version of OpenGL.

The only open implementation of OpenGL that I know of is
[Mesa3D](http://www.mesa3d.org).  It's a software renderer used primarily by
GNU/Linux.
