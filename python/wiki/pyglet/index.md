Pyglet, A Perhaps Useful Guide
==============================

Pyglet is a pure-python library that accesses your native OpenGL calls on your
OS.  It actually does a lot of other cool stuff.  But from a graphics
perspective, this is important.  Using a tool called gengl.py, it automatically
generates all the python hooks to access everything you could want to access
in OpenGL including extensions and other stuff.  It also does all the set up
for you.

If you take a look at [Pyglet Drawing](pyglet-drawing.md), it will show you how
pyglet organizes things so as to provide very efficient and fast rendering. 

The main thing to take away from that is that pyglet is very fast when it keeps
rendering the same things.  If you create an environment where pyglet has to 
keep adding new things, then it will be very slow.  This includes clearing and 
re-adding already existing items.  

The most efficient way to use pyglet is to essentially create diffs between 
frames.  If nothing has changed for an element, then the diff is nothing. 

A paused game should be hyper fast because the diff should be empty. 

When making something hidden, it is faster to set its alpha to zero or set all 
the vertices in the object to (0, 0).
