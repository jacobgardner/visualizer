COMPONENT DESCRIPTION - PRELIMINARY
===================================

This document shall serve as a high-level overview of what each component of 
the visualizer architecture shall be responsible for.

UI - PRELIMINARY
----------------
The UI contains Widgets which are objects just like in the Timeline. Widgets
contain a set of procedures expected in the UI.  The UI should draw all the
objects it contains, and send appropriate inputs to the objects.  Individual
objects should contain the logic to handle clicks, hovers, drags (not the
queen-style), etc.  If no widget responds to the input, the UI should tell the 
input system it didn't know what to do.

Timeline - PRELIMINARY
----------------------
The timeline is responsible for telling what to draw, when and under what state.
This is the backbone of the visualizer and will be reponsible for presenting
information in the most accurate way possible given the desired playback format.
Playback formats shall be one of several possible modes:

* Unit Mode - This is a first class citizen of the timeline and should be the
easiest to draw.  This should show units moving and performing actions one at 
a time and should have a properly ordered 1-1 correlation with the commands 
sent from each client.  Competitors should be spending about 10% of their time
in this mode.
* Normal Mode - This mode is where competitors should be spending about 90% of 
their time in this mode.  While not entirely accurate, the information 
displayed in this mode should be as accurate as possible given that almost all 
units will be moving at once.  Objects that do not interact with each other in 
any way should perform their actions simulaneously.  Objects that interact with 
each other should be appropriately animated such that the displayed information 
shows the object state dependence on actions.  
* Condensed Mode - Condensed mode is similar to normal mode except that two
turns are animated at the same time instead of just one in normal mode.  This
will probably not be used much and should probably be an afterthought. 
* Liquid Mode - This is a theoretical mode between unit and normal mode where
units begin their movement slightly lagging behind other units showing the order
of actions, but not entirely blocking everything else. 

Renderer - PRELIMINARY
----------------------
The renderer shall contain a set of procedures that Objects can call to get
stuff drawn to the screen.  It will automatically look for resources based on
the input texture name if it's not already loaded.  It should also deallocate
resources it hasn't been using in a while.

Input - PRELIMINARY
-------------------
This shall look for input events from the user and send them to the appropriate
component.  In the initial implementation, this shall be the UI, then the
Timeline, if no UI Widget has responded appropriately.

Inputs that should be sent are:
* Downbutton (For Drags)
* Upbutton (left, right, and middle)
* Selections (If no downbutton was responded too)
* Keypresses
* Voice Commands :|

Controller - PRELIMINARY
------------------------
This shall tell the timeline where it should currently be, and handle a few
other general things in the system.  The config module should primarily be used
by this.

Networking - PRELIMINARY
------------------------
Shall support spectating.  More details to follow.
